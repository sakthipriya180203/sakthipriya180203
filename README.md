# 💫 About Me:
I am a Mechatronics Engineer with a strong interest in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Intelligent Embedded Systems. My work focuses on building practical, real-world systems by integrating hardware and software seamlessly.<br><br>I developed an Intelligent Shopping Cart using ESP32, MH-ET LIVE barcode scanner, load cell (HX711), and Bluetooth, achieving real-time billing with validation across 20+ products and securing a top 1% project ranking. I also built a Hand Gesture Recognition System with 90% classification accuracy, creating interactive applications such as AI-based Rock-Paper-Scissors, Air Canvas, and Air Piano using computer vision techniques.<br><br>With hands-on experience in Python, NumPy, Pandas, embedded development (Arduino IDE), and system integration, I enjoy designing automation-driven solutions that solve practical problems. My internships in manufacturing engineering enhanced my understanding of production systems, where I contributed to a 15% improvement in production rate.<br><br>I am particularly interested in AI-driven robotics, intelligent automation, and applied machine learning systems that bridge the gap between physical hardware and smart software.
